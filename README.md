# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance-
## ðŸ“Š Overview

Employee attrition is a major concern for businesses as it results in high recruitment and training costs along with lost productivity. This project analyzes employee attrition data to uncover the underlying factors contributing to employee turnover using Power BI and Python.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

The objective is to identify patterns and key drivers of employee attrition using HR data. The insights gained will support HR teams in creating better employee retention strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Source

* The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Data includes 1,470 employee records with 35 features like age, income, job role, satisfaction level, overtime, etc.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

* **Power BI** for interactive dashboards
* **Python (Visual Studio, Jupyter Notebook)** for data cleaning and preprocessing
* Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

## ðŸ“Œ Key Tasks

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Removed duplicates
* Checked and handled missing values
* Set appropriate data types

### 2. Visual Analysis

* Attrition rate distribution
* Attrition by job role, age, gender, education, and department
* Monthly income comparisons by education and attrition
* Job satisfaction and overtime impact

### 3. Dashboard Development

* Interactive filters: attrition status, department, education field, income level, job role, etc.
* Key metrics: Attrition rate, average income, employee count, job involvement

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

* **Overall Attrition Rate**: 16.12%
* **Highest Attrition**: Sales (38.8%) and R\&D (56.1%) departments
* **Job Roles at Risk**: Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives
* **Age Group Most Affected**: 28â€“39 years
* **Overtime Impact**: 53.6% of those who left worked overtime
* **Satisfaction Level**: 30.4% of attrition cases had the lowest satisfaction rating

## ðŸ§ª Hypotheses

Factors likely contributing to attrition include:
